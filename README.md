# Blazor Server DataGrid - Globalization with CLDR Files

This is demo application to load the translation json files and CLDR data files to apply formats and translations based on the specified culture.

> This sample is created in **.NET Core 3.0 Preview 8**.

## Overview

This sample shows how to integrate the [Blazor DataGrid](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-datagrid) component into a Blazor Server application with full globalization support. The application demonstrates loading locale-specific translation files and CLDR data to dynamically apply number formats, date formats, currency formats, and timezone information based on the selected culture.
